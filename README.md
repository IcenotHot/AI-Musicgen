# Melody Generation with MusicGen and Online Community System
This project combines AI-based music composition and a web-based online community platform.
Using MusicGen, an automatic melody generation model, users can create new melodies based on text prompts or input audio. The generated melodies can then be shared within an online community where users can listen, comment, and collaborate on music ideas.

The system aims to make music creation more accessible for everyone, allowing beginners and professionals to experiment with AI-powered composition tools.

The web platform is developed using Flask (Python) and PHP integrated with a MySQL(Xampp) database
